/**
 * Creates a normalized {@link GridBox} from an origin and a diagonal vector.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - This function does not attach the box to any global grid; the coordinates
 *   are interpreted in an abstract local reference system.
 * - `origin` is treated as a position for the bottom-left corner.
 * - `diagonal` is treated as a size/extent vector; its components are made
 *   non-negative so that the resulting box has a well-defined width and height.
 *
 * @param origin - Bottom-left corner of the box in local coordinates.
 * @param diagonal - Vector from `origin` toward the opposite corner. Its `x`
 * and `y` components may be negative on input; they are converted to absolute
 * values during normalization.
 *
 * @returns A normalized {@link GridBox} where `diagonal.x` and `diagonal.y`
 * are guaranteed to be non-negative.
